[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot) is an open-source personal AI assistant that works across WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and a built-in WebChat interface. This guide covers every step from launching a fresh AWS EC2 instance to a working OpenClaw deployment, using Telegram as the example channel with your choice of LLM provider.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have these ready:

- **An AWS account** with EC2 access
- **An API key** for your chosen LLM provider (see the [Model Providers](#model-providers) section for the full list)
- **A Telegram bot token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
- **Your Telegram user ID** from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram (this is a numeric ID, not your username)

## What You'll Set Up

- An EC2 instance running Ubuntu 24.04
- Docker and CapRover as the deployment platform (handles containers, app management, and logs)
- OpenClaw running as a CapRover app with persistent config and data
- Telegram as the chat channel restricted to the user IDs you allow
- Your choice of LLM (Gemini, Claude, GPT, open-source models, etc.)

## Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

Go to the [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and click **Launch instance**.

**Name and AMI.** Give the instance a name (e.g., `openclaw-prod`). Select **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (64-bit x86) as the AMI.

**Instance type.** Choose `c7i-flex.large` (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM).

**Key pair.** Click **Create new key pair**. Set the type to RSA and format to `.pem`. Download the file and save it somewhere safe.

**Security Group.** Under Network settings, the **Allow SSH traffic from** checkbox is already checked by default. Keep it, and also check these two:

- **Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet**
- **Allow HTTP traffic from the internet**

Then click **Edit** (top right of the Network settings section) to add two more inbound rules:

| Type | Port | Source | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| Custom TCP | 3000 | `0.0.0.0/0` | CapRover dashboard |
| Custom TCP | 18789 | `0.0.0.0/0` | OpenClaw gateway + dashboard |

**Storage.** Change the root volume to **30 GB gp3**. The default 8 GB is too small for Docker images.

Click **Launch instance**. Wait for the instance to reach the **Running** state, then note its **Public IPv4 address**.

## Step 2: SSH into the Server

```bash
ssh -i "openclaw-key.pem" ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP
```

Replace `YOUR_EC2_IP` with the public IPv4 address from the EC2 console.

## Step 3: Install Docker and CapRover

Update the system and install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
```

### Deploy CapRover

CapRover is a self-hosted PaaS that manages Docker containers through a web dashboard. With Docker installed, run:

```bash
sudo docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ACCEPTED_TERMS=true \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /captain:/captain \
  caprover/caprover
```

Wait until you see `Captain is initialized` in the output. Then open `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000` in your browser and log in with the default password `captain42`. **Change this password immediately** under the **Settings** section in the dashboard. Port 3000 is open to the internet and the default password is publicly known.

## Step 4: Create the App

In the CapRover dashboard:

1. Go to **Apps**
2. Enter `openclaw` as the app name
3. Check **Has Persistent Data**
4. Click **Create New App**

The persistent data checkbox is critical. Without it, your config and data are wiped on every redeployment.

## Step 5: Configure the App

Open the `openclaw` app in CapRover and configure the following across two tabs.

### HTTP Settings Tab

Change the **Container HTTP Port** from `80` to `18789`. This is the port OpenClaw's gateway listens on.

Enable **WebSocket Support**. OpenClaw's gateway uses WebSocket connections, and they will fail silently without this.

### App Configs Tab

**Environment Variables.** Add the following. The first variable depends on your LLM provider (see [Model Providers](#model-providers) for the full list):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Your provider's API key variable | Your API key (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Your bot token from BotFather |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32` on your server |

For the gateway token, run `openssl rand -hex 32` in your SSH session. Copy the output and paste it as the value. This token secures the gateway's WebSocket API and is also used to access the dashboard in [Step 9](#step-9-access-the-dashboard).

**Persistent Directories.** Add two entries:

| Path in App | Label |
|-------------|-------|
| `/home/node/.openclaw` | `openclaw-config` |
| `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace` | `openclaw-workspace` |

The first directory holds `openclaw.json` (the main configuration file) and credentials. The second holds workspace data like memory and agent files. Both survive redeployments.

**Port Mapping.** Add one entry so the gateway port is accessible directly on the server:

| Server Port | Container Port |
|-------------|----------------|
| `18789` | `18789` |

**Service Update Override.** Paste this JSON:

```json
{
  "TaskTemplate": {
    "ContainerSpec": {
      "Command": ["node", "dist/index.js"],
      "Args": ["gateway", "--bind", "lan"]
    }
  }
}
```

This tells CapRover exactly how to start the OpenClaw process. The `--bind lan` flag makes the gateway listen on all network interfaces so it is reachable from outside the container (the default `loopback` mode only listens inside the container). Without this override, the container may fail with "too many arguments for gateway" because CapRover's default entrypoint handling does not match what OpenClaw expects.

Click **Save & Update** after each change.

## Step 6: Write the Configuration File

SSH into your server and write the `openclaw.json` config directly to the Docker volume. On EC2, you need `sudo bash -c` because you are logged in as `ubuntu`, not `root`. This example uses Gemini, but you can substitute any model from the [Model Providers](#model-providers) section:

````bash
sudo bash -c 'cat > /var/lib/docker/volumes/captain--openclaw-config/_data/openclaw.json << '\''EOF'\''
{
  "gateway": {
    "mode": "local",
    "trustedProxies": ["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12"],
    "controlUi": {
      "allowInsecureAuth": true
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
      },
      "maxConcurrent": 4,
      "subagents": {
        "maxConcurrent": 8
      }
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID"],
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist"
    }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "telegram": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF'
````

Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID` with the numeric ID you got from @userinfobot. This restricts the bot to only respond to your messages.

### Key Config Decisions

- **`mode: "local"`** runs the gateway in single-node mode. This is the right choice for an EC2 deployment.
- **`trustedProxies`** tells the gateway which IP ranges to trust for `X-Forwarded-For` headers so it can correctly identify client IPs behind CapRover's nginx proxy. Docker Swarm's default overlay pool is `10.0.0.0/8`, and bridge/ingress networks use the `172.16.0.0/12` range. The [official docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security) recommend being as specific as possible, but since Docker Swarm assigns these IPs dynamically, both ranges are included here to cover CapRover's internal networking.
- **`dmPolicy: "allowlist"`** means only user IDs listed in `allowFrom` can DM the bot. Everyone else is blocked.
- **`groupPolicy: "allowlist"`** means the bot will not respond in any Telegram groups unless you explicitly allow them.
- **`controlUi.allowInsecureAuth`** allows the dashboard to work over plain HTTP. Without this, the Control UI requires HTTPS or localhost access. This is a security trade-off for convenience since the gateway token will be visible in your browser history and server logs. If you later set up a domain with HTTPS, you can remove this setting.

### Set File Ownership

OpenClaw runs as user `node` (UID 1000) inside the container. The volume files need matching ownership:

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/lib/docker/volumes/captain--openclaw-config/_data/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/lib/docker/volumes/captain--openclaw-workspace/_data/
```

Verify the config was written correctly:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/captain--openclaw-config/_data/openclaw.json
```

This should print back the JSON you just wrote.

## Step 7: Deploy

Go to the **Deployment** tab of the `openclaw` app in CapRover. Paste the following captain-definition and click **Deploy**:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "dockerfileLines": ["FROM ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest"]
}
```

This pulls the latest OpenClaw image from GitHub Container Registry and deploys it.

## Step 8: Verify

Check the app logs in CapRover. A successful startup looks like this:

```
[gateway] listening on ws://0.0.0.0:18789
[telegram] starting provider (@yourbotname)
```

The first line confirms the gateway is running. The second confirms Telegram integration is active with your bot. Open Telegram and send a message to your bot. It should respond.

## Step 9: Access the Dashboard

OpenClaw includes a web dashboard for managing config, channels, agents, and sessions. Open it at:

```
http://YOUR_EC2_IP:18789?token=YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_EC2_IP` with your instance's public IP and `YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN` with the token you set in the `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Model Providers

OpenClaw is model-agnostic. To switch providers, change the `agents.defaults.model.primary` value in `openclaw.json` and set the corresponding API key as an environment variable in CapRover. The pattern is always `provider/model-id`.

| Provider | Environment Variable | Example Model |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai/gpt-5.2` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `groq/llama-3.3-70b` |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | `mistral/mistral-large-latest` |
| xAI | `XAI_API_KEY` | `xai/grok-3` |
| Cerebras | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | `cerebras/llama3.1-70b` |
| Z.AI (GLM) | `ZAI_API_KEY` | `zai/glm-4.7` |

OpenRouter is worth noting separately: it gives access to 300+ models through a single API key, so you can switch between providers without managing multiple keys.

OpenClaw also supports Ollama, Amazon Bedrock, LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint through the `models.providers` config block. See the [OpenClaw Model Providers documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/model-providers) for setup instructions on those.

## Updating the Configuration

Config changes do not require a redeployment. Edit the configuration from the **Config** page in the OpenClaw dashboard. Changes are picked up automatically.

## Updating OpenClaw

To pull the latest version, redeploy the same captain-definition from the Deployment tab:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "dockerfileLines": ["FROM ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest"]
}
```

Your config and data are stored on persistent volumes, so nothing is lost during redeployment.

## Conclusion

That is the complete setup: an EC2 instance, CapRover as the platform, a single JSON config file, a few environment variables, and one Docker image. Config changes can be made through the dashboard with no redeployment needed. Version updates are a one-click redeploy that preserves all your data.

From here, you can swap models, add group chat support, or extend with browser automation (covered in a separate guide).
